# Sandbox

*Me trying to learn to code the Amiga, back in the 90s I mostly played games with it. Now I'll finally have fun in other ways.
While waiting for my real A1200 to get refurbished and in good condition I started coding on WinUAE which led me to some insights. (No I don't want to code on Win/Lin - I do that at the office every day)*

## AMOS

Was fun, horribly user interface though, I had to do some youtubing to understand that menu. Worse, it seem to not like emulators, tried different ways but now and then I got "Not Done" message when trying to save a file. Some pointed out the filesystem
might dislike the emulators so I'll abandon that one until I get the real hardware. I even bought a book for it :)

## BlitzBasic2

Fun, i found the PDf book by Adam Zalepa and was working my way through that one when I for some reason decided to try AmiBlitz which ruined my BB2 install. 
Totally worth it though. AmiBlitz3 and PED is easier for me it seems. Some small things might have changed so doublecheck the Amiblitz guides if you are following BB2 tutorials. 
Also, be careful when creating executables since Amiblitz may sneak in requirements for FPU. If you really want to target lowend Amigas, BB2 is safer

## C

Only started this one so far. I will wait until I got AmigaOS3.2 installed so I can try codecraft, so far I only have Vim. (and yeah, VsCode if I want to work on win/linux)

## Assembler

Now I'm having fun, although I had to checkout both Asm-Pro and Asm-One cause i didn't understand them and thought something were wrong. n00b
