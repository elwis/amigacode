# Sandbox
*Me trying to learn to code the Amiga, back in the 90s I mostly played games with it. Now I'll finally have fun in other ways.
While waiting for my real A1200 to get refurbished and in good condition I started coding on WinUAE which led me to some insights. (No I don't want to code on Win/Lin - I do that at the office every day)*

## AMOS
Was fun, horribly user interface though, I had to do some youtubing to understand that menu. Worse, it seem to not like emulators, tried different ways but now and then I got "Not Done" message when trying to save a file. Some pointed out the filesystem
might dislike the emulators so I'll abandon that one until I get the real hardware. I even bought a book for it :)

## BlitzBasic2
Fun, i found the PDf book by Adam Zalepa and was working my way through that one when I for some reasdo0n decided to try AmiBlitz which ruined my BB2 install. Will probably go back to it later.

## AmiBlitz3
Only looked at it. The first one with what seem to be an always modern IDE. Need some gode guides for that one but will probably try it out some more.

## C
Only started this one, had some struggle with vbcc and configuration but from what I remember that's C and there's a reason for make and the build-tools.

## Assembler
Now I'm having fun, although I had to checkout both Asm-Pro and Asm-One cause i didn't understand them and thought something were wrong. I'll stay here for awhile I think
